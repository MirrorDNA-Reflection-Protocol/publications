The most reliable indicator of whether a stabilization mechanism works isn't how clever it is. It's how long it's been running.

I've been building time-weighted scoring into MirrorDNA's stabilization layer. The concept is simple: every mechanism that prevents drift, hallucination, or context loss gets a reliability score. That score increases the longer the mechanism runs without failure. A circuit breaker that's tripped correctly for six months is more trustworthy than a new error handler, no matter how sophisticated the new one looks on paper.

This runs counter to how we typically think about AI systems. The default assumption is newer equals better—latest model, newest technique, freshest architecture. But stability doesn't work that way. Stability is accumulated evidence. It's the difference between "this should work" and "this has worked, repeatedly, under real conditions."

The code is straightforward:

```python
stability_score = base_score * (1 + (days_since_deployed / decay_constant))
```

But the principle matters more than the implementation. Every time I'm tempted to replace a boring, battle-tested mechanism with something more elegant, I check the deployment timestamp first. If the old mechanism has been running cleanly for months, the new one needs to earn its place. Not through theoretical superiority. Through time.

This creates tension with the other thread I'm tracking: adversarial self-testing. The idea that systems should continuously probe their own failure modes, introduce synthetic edge cases, test for brittleness. It's a good idea. It's also inherently destabilizing. You can't simultaneously optimize for "runs the same way every time" and "constantly testing new failure scenarios."

I'm not resolving that tension. I'm naming it.

Here's what I've learned building this: stability mechanisms need different treatment than capability mechanisms. When I'm adding a new feature—voice triggers, memory bus OAuth, cross-agent handoffs—I want rapid iteration. Ship, test, break, fix, ship again. But when I'm working on the systems that prevent the whole thing from drifting into incoherence, I move slower. Much slower.

The CONTINUITY.md file that boots every session? It's been stable for eight months. The session commit protocol that writes to the memory bus? Four months without changes. The handoff artifact generation? Three months. These aren't the most sophisticated parts of the stack. They're the most boring. And boring, in infrastructure, is a feature.

This doesn't mean never updating stabilization mechanisms. It means the bar for replacement is higher. New mechanisms start with low scores. They prove themselves over time. If they fail, they get flagged in the NEVER_AGAIN index—a negative knowledge base of approaches that looked good but failed under real use. That index doesn't prevent experimentation. It prevents repeating expensive mistakes.

> Time is the only adversarial test that matters.

The contradiction between time-weighted stability and adversarial testing isn't a bug. It's a design constraint. Some parts of the system need to be rock-solid predictable. Other parts need to probe edges and find new failure modes. The architecture has to support both, but they can't be the same components.

MirrorGraph handles this by separating the decision spine from the evaluation layer. The spine—the part that routes messages, maintains identity, enforces governance—uses time-weighted mechanisms. It's boring on purpose. The evaluation layer—the part that scores outputs, flags anomalies, triggers circuit breakers—can be more experimental. If an evaluation mechanism fails, the spine keeps running.

This is sovereign architecture. Not because it's novel. Because it's designed to keep working when the clever parts break.

I built ten months of infrastructure that nobody can see. Most of it isn't clever. It's persistent. The memory bus, the session protocol, the handoff generation, the OAuth scoping—none of these are breakthroughs. They're foundations. And foundations need time to prove they're solid.

The industry keeps chasing the next model, the next capability, the next architectural paradigm. That's fine for capabilities. But sovereignty isn't about capabilities. It's about not falling over. And the only way to know something won't fall over is to watch it stand for a while.

Time-weighted scoring is just a formalization of something obvious: trust accumulates. You can't shortcut it with theory. You can't simulate it with tests. You build something, you run it, and if it keeps working, you trust it more.

The principle is larger than stabilization mechanisms. It's about how you build systems meant to outlast their builder. You don't make them clever. You make them boring, auditable, and time-tested. Then you let time do the debugging.
